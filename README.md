# Astra-ride-bus-management-system



A distributed microservices-based bus booking platform designed for scalability, reliability, and modern development practices. This project demonstrates a polyglot architecture using Spring Boot, .NET, Node.js, multiple databases, and a robust set of infrastructure components.

---

## üö¶ System Overview

This platform allows users to view bus schedules, make bookings, complete payments, and receive notifications, all powered by independent yet connected services. The system leverages service discovery, centralized configuration, secure authentication, event-driven communication, and an API gateway for unified access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Features

- **Service Discovery**: Eureka enables dynamic registration and discovery of all services.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Spring Cloud Config Server manages configuration across all environments.
- **API Gateway**: Single, secure entry point for all client requests, with routing and filtering.
- **Event-Driven**: Kafka enables robust, decoupled communication between services.
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Each service uses the database best suited for its needs (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firestore).
- **Authentication**: Secured by Keycloak, supporting OAuth2 flows and role-based access.
- **Scalability**: Each service can be independently deployed and scaled.

## üöß Planned Services

- **Payment Service:**  
  - Built with Spring Boot & PostgreSQL.
  - Handles secure payment transactions and integrates with booking flow.

- **Notification Service:**  
  - Built with Node.js & MongoDB.
  - Sends confirmation emails, SMS, or push notifications to users.

- **Seat Service:**  
  - Built with Node.js & Firestore.
  - Manages real-time seat selection and availability.

- **Spring Cloud Gateway:**  
  - To be set up as the unified API gateway.

---

## üîê Security & Authentication

- **Keycloak** will manage user authentication and authorization.
- All sensitive endpoints will be protected via OAuth2/OpenID Connect.

---

## üì° Communication

- **RabbitMq** is used for asynchronous, event-based communication between services (e.g., booking events triggering notifications or payments).

---

## üåç How It Works

1. **User Authentication:**  
   Users sign in via Keycloak and receive JWT tokens and User registration handles by user service.

2. **Timetable Viewing:**  
   Users fetch available busses for today via the Timetable Service.

3. **Booking:**  
   Bookings are made through the Booking Service, which checks seat availability and reserves seats.

4. **Payment:**  
   Upon booking, a payment request is sent to the Payment Service (via Kafka).

5. **Notification:**  
   After a successful booking/payment, the Notification Service informs the user.

6. **Seat Management:**  
   Seat Service ensures real-time updates to seat status.
